Just a set of replacements for the stock exoplanet textures and asteroid.jpg. I've also included a generic desert world. For best results, dump all the textures in Celestia/textures/hires, and then find and replace all instances of "asteroid.*" in your exoplanet catalogue with "desert.*". 

Do something cool with them, and credit me (CubicApoc) when you do.

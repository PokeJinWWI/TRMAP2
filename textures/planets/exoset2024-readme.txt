Just a set of replacements for the stock exoplanet textures and asteroid.jpg, plus a few bonus textures. For best results, dump all the textures in Celestia/textures/hires. It's also a good idea to find & replace all instances of asteroid.jpg in your exoplanet catalogs with desert.jpg. 

Updated 2024 version includes:
- additional neptunelike and volcanic textures;
    volcanic texture is based on my Volcanic Moon remake
    (https://celestiaproject.space/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=24408)
- asteroid.jpg is now "Yet another asteroid texture"
    (https://celestiaproject.space/forum/viewtopic.php?f=23&t=24371)
- exo-class2 & 3 now show brownish organic hazes
- color tweaks to exo-class1 & 4

Do something cool with them, and please credit me (CubicApoc) when you do.
